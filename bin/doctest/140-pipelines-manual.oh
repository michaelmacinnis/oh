## ### Pipelines and Filters
##
## The standard output of one command may be connected to the standard input
## of another command using the pipe operator.
##
##     ls | wc -l
ls | wc -l | tr -s ' ' | sed -e 's/^[ 	]*//g' # Remove duplicate spaces and leading whitespace.
##
## The commands connected in this way constitute a pipeline. The overall
## effect is the same as,
##
##     ls >file; wc -l file
ls >file; wc -l file | tr -s ' ' | sed -e 's/^[ 	]*//g' # Remove duplicate spaces and leading whitespace.
##
## except that no file is used. Instead the two processes are connected by a
## pipe and are run in parallel.
##
## A pipeline may consist of more than two commands.
##
##     ls | grep old | wc -l
ls | grep old | wc -l | tr -s ' ' | sed -e 's/^[ 	]*//g' # Remove duplicate spaces and leading whitespace.
##
## To redirect the output of a command to a file that already exists (replacing
## the contents of the file), pipe the output of the command to the `clobber`
## command.

ls | clobber file
